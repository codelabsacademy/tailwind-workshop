# Code Labs Academy - Tailwind CSS Workshop

**üë®‚Äçüíª This repository serves as a support for the youtube video on the [Introduction to Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNZZZOpLSxI&t=2025s) Workshop**

## About this workshop

Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework, like Bootstrap and Bulma. However, Tailwind does things less conventionally when compared to traditional CSS frameworks. Tailwind CSS is a great option for rapidly building responsive user interfaces with total control over the styles, allowing every site to be truly unique from another. It provides greater flexibility and control over the design while being a good constraint to guide the development process.
In this workshop, you will learn how to write CSS using Tailwind from the perspective of a JavaScript developer. Start from the basics and walk up to more advanced CSS and Tailwind patterns and best practices.

Check the official documentation of Tailwind CSS from [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).
